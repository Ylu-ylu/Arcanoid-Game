Classic Arkanoid Game 
A modern implementation of the iconic brick-breaking arcade game featuring dynamic ball physics, responsive paddle controls, and engaging gameplay mechanics. Built with C++ and SFML for optimal performance and crisp visual rendering.
The game offers smooth platform movement, realistic ball bouncing physics with angle-based deflection, and an intuitive scoring system that rewards skillful play. Players control a movable platform to keep the ball in play while aiming to achieve high scores through precise ball handling.
Key features include collision detection with customizable bounce angles, score tracking with persistent high score records, and game state management for a complete arcade experience. The object-oriented architecture ensures clean code separation while SFML integration delivers fluid graphics and responsive audio feedback.

## SFMLTemplate
This is simple template project for developing games with SFML library.
Just open the Game.sln, compile and run project named Game. If you want to create a game - copy it, renaming it's directory and files SFMLTemplate.vcxproj and SFMLTemplate.vcxproj.filters.
Then add new project to Game.sln via visual studio.
